# AcousticSimulationFramework
This repository contains code for an acoustic simulation framework that can be used for acoustic/ultrasonic indoor positioning and/or data driven applications. For this simulation you need to fork the Pyroomacoustics package local and switch the room.py and material.dat files. The wood_techtile material can be used in the ultrasonic domain as a wooden surface. Absorbers can also be used.
